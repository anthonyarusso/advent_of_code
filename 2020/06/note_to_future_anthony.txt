When working on day 6 part two you used

if current_group.is_empty()

to determine if you were working on the first line of
a new group. This was flawed because you removed char
elements from the current_group vector if they were
not shared by all members of the group. I.e. if the
first person answered yes to 'a' and the second yes to
only 'b' then current_group would already be emptied
since there is no answer all the members of the group
shared.

This is an issue because there could still be more
members of a group, but the current_group vector would
be emptied sooner than expected. Using 

if current_group.is_empty()

to detect the first line of a new group allowed it to
be triggered early under the above circumstances.
